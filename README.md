# Python_Movie Correlation Project
### Background


The purpose of this project is to use Python to help see the data correlation in the Movie dataset.


In this project, I perform the following actions:

**Data Cleaning**
1. Make sure the data are in the right data type.
2. Extract the correct Year from one of the date column.
3. Drop any duplicates values

**Data Analysis**
1. Set hypothesis on the related pairs of data correlation
2. Create scatter plot to see the trend
3. Create heatmap to see the correlation
4. Draw conclusion
